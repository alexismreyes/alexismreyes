## ðŸš€ Projects
### Its rather new to me to start sharing projects...If you find anything useful feel free to use it.

- **huggingface-ai**: Implementation of AI models using React + Express Server + HuggingFace API - [huggingface-ai-frontend.onrender.com](https://huggingface-ai-frontend.onrender.com/)/ (First requests to models in production appears to be lazy to load, i suppose its because the free tier on Render.com which provides minimum hardware resources, following request works fine)
